# Tero Edge

This repo contains the source code for the Tero Edge project. Tero Edge is a lightweight, high-performance telemetry proxy that enables efficient telemetry processing via a set of policies (defined HERE.) The repository is structured to be modularized to enable multiple use cases and scenarios.

## Current Configurations

1. Edge data proxy
  a. This configuration receives data in a gateway or sidecar configuration, processes the data through its policy engine, and forwards it to the next destination.
