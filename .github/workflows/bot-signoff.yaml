name: bot-signoff

# This workflow runs the same signoff process for bots that humans run locally.
# It handles:
# - Bot PRs (Renovate, Dependabot)
# - Master branch pushes (post-merge validation)
# - Manual trigger via 'ci' label
#
# Bots and humans follow the exact same validation process via 'task signoff'.
